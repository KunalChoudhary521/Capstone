# Capstone Project -- Sleep Apnea Diagnoser

This is a software package was designed as a capstone project in ECE496. The goal of this project was
to help the Sleep Science team at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institution to analyzes physiological 
signals in order determine severity of Sleep Apnea. Sleep Apnea is a disorder that causes periods 
of shallow or absent breathing while sleeping.

Originally, the project was hosted on Team Foundation Server (TFS). I have recently migrated the 
project from TFS to Github. As a result, most of my commit messages are recorded under the label
'Kunal-CUSTOM' rather than KunalChoudhary521.
